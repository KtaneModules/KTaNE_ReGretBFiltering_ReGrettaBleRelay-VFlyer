  description: "[i]Taking a break? I don't need a break yet![/i]\r\n\r\nThis is a
    public version of a practice variant of ReGret-B Filtering, designed for users
    who are not comfortable calculating 3 operators within 75 seconds. This module
    consists of 3 stages where you must perform different operators on each stage
    to disarm the module. Each operator is calculated uniquely like ReGret-B Filtering
    however you will have to do at least 1 of these rather than being able to wait
    it out.\r\nWhen you are ready, subscribe to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2172702283]ReGret-B
    Filtering[/url] for the true challenge.\r\n\r\nOriginal variant by Obvious\r\nPractice
    variant by VFlyer, modified for ease of difficulty"
